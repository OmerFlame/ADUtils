# ADUtils

This is the ADUtils CocoaPods package made by faberNovel (original repository [here](https://github.com/faberNovel/ADUtils)), but with added Swift Package Manager support.

NOTE: This is unmaintained and it never will be. I made this very shoddily and quickly in order to save time and clutter in my current devRant rewrite project (repository [here](https://github.com/OmerFlame/AltRant)).

Tests are not included on purpose because the tests require packages that are CocoaPods only.
